        <h1>About Petfinder</h1>

        <hr>
    
        <p style="font-size:25px;">Petfinder is an online, searchable database of animals who need homes. 
            It is also a directory of nearly 11,000 animal shelters and adoption organizations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
            Organizations maintain their own home pages and available-pet databases.</p>
    
          <strong><h2 style="color: red">Our mission</h2></strong> 
    
        <strong><p style="color: red">To use Internet technology and the resources it can generate to:</p></strong>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets</li></strong>
            <strong><li>Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across North America to the extent that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated</li></strong>
            <strong><li>Elevate the status of pets to that of family member</li></strong>
        </ol>

           <p>From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches their needs. 
               They can then reference a shelter’s web page and discover what services it offers. Petfinder also includes discussion forums, 
               a pet-care resource directory and a library of free pet-care articles to help keep pets in their homes.</p>
    
            <h2>Petfinder is updated DAILY.</h2>  
            <p>Organizations wishing to participate should register. A contact person should be responsible for direct communications with Petfinder.

    <hr>
            <p>Petfinder is made up of animal-care professionals and regular people volunteering for their local animal welfare organizations all 
            working together to maintain active and accurate homeless pet lists. Most animal welfare volunteers have “real jobs” by day. The success and the magnitude of this project is largely due to their 
            tireless efforts to make a difference. If you would like to help, let us know! You can find us at <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/" target="_blank">petfinder</a>. Or email us at <a href="mailto:pets@petfinder.com" target="_blank">pets@petfinder.com</a></p>
